# Governance Risk and Compliance Project 

## 🛡️ Conducting an end-to-end Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment (using NIST CSF)

**Scenario**:
Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio project based on a simulated consulting assignment with **Oscorp**, a fictional organization specializing in bioengineering and scientific research. This project showcases how I approached solving various security challenges across multiple domains.

## 🔐 Cyber Security Risk Management – CIA Triad

Here, we outlined the practical application of Cybersecurity Risk Management through the lens of the CIA Triad—Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. By asking targeted assessment questions, it helps identify potential vulnerabilities in how documents and data are accessed, modified, and stored. Followed up with recommendations.

### 🧠 Key Questions for Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: Who should access the document? Are controls in place?
- **Integrity**: Who can edit it? Are changes traceable?
- **Availability**: Should it be available 24/7? Is it backed up?

### ✅ Recommendations
- Enforce strict access controls (read/write).
- Use document encryption and versioning.
- Maintain physical and digital backups.

## 📋 Cyber Security Audit – Three Lines of Defense Model

This section presents a structured approach to cybersecurity auditing using the Three Lines of Defense Model, a widely recognized framework for risk management and assurance. It defines clear roles and responsibilities across the three lines of defense model.

### 🧱 Proposed Audit Structure
- **Line 1 – Control Owners**: Daily monitoring & incident detection.
- **Line 2 – Independent Reviewers**: Validate controls and policy adherence.
- **Line 3 – Internal Auditors**: Verify compliance and follow up.

## 💼 Asset Management

Effective Asset Management is a cornerstone of any robust cybersecurity program. Knowing what assets exist-hardware, software, data, and systems-is essential for assessing risk, ensuring compliance, and responding to incidents. 

### 🔧 Recommendations
- Launch an asset inventory process.
- Implement a dedicated CMDB system.
- Assign ownership (e.g., GRC Analyst).
- Keep the CMDB continuously updated.

---

## 👤 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

This section highlights key Identity and Access Management (IAM) issues, focusing on excessive access to sensitive data and administrative controls. Recommendations were made to reduce risk and strengthen security.

### 🔒 IAM Observations
- Broad access to sensitive formula.
- Full admin access to database.

### ✅ Recommendations
- Implement PAM software.
- Enforce least privilege and MFA.
- Apply RBAC and ACLs.
- Segregate sensitive environments.

---

## 📣 Security Education and Awareness

Addressing the importance of a strong Security Education and Awareness program as a frontline defense against cyber threats is very important. 

### 📊 Program Evaluation
- Training module is outdated (since 2013).

### ✅ Recommendations
- Update content to reflect modern threats.
- Make training mandatory (staff, vendors, third parties).
- Run simulated phishing tests.
- Provide annual and refresher training.

---

## 🛡️ Data Security & DLP – Insider Threat Program

Protecting sensitive information from within the organization is addressed through the development of a strong Insider Threat Program.

### 🚨 Components
- Encrypt data (at rest & in transit).
- Use DLP to prevent leaks.
- Classify data using Microsoft AIP.

---

## ⚙️ Detection & Incident Response

We highlighted key actions necessary for effective Detection and Incident Response.

### 🧪 Response Plan
- Conduct baseline assessment.
- Document policies and response plans.
- Set up a cybersecurity team.
- Use SIEM/DLP tools.
- Run periodic drills.

---

## 🤝 Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

Effective management of third-party risks is critical to safeguarding your organization from external threats.

### 🔍 Key Risks
- No cyber framework.
- No penetration testing.
- No RBAC or access reviews.
- Training is not enforced.

### 📢 Escalate to Management
- Implement TPRM governance and monitoring.

---

## 🛠️ Vulnerability Management

Proactively identifying and addressing security weaknesses is key to reducing risk. 

### ✅ Recommendations
- Run regular scans and patching.
- Remove unauthorized software.
- Automate vulnerability management.

---

## 🧩 Capstone: Cybersecurity Program using NIST CSF

Developing a robust cybersecurity program involves identifying gaps and implementing a clear, step-by-step roadmap. This section reviews major shortcomings and outlines a phased 3-year plan based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to improve security maturity.

### 🔍 Gaps Identified
- No data governance or security policies.
- No SIEM, DLP, PAM.
- No third-party risk or formalized contracts.

### 📈 3-Year Roadmap

| Year | Goals |
|------|-------|
| 1️⃣ | Assess and deploy core security tools |
| 2️⃣ | Build out monitoring, IAM, and response plans |
| 3️⃣ | Integrate & optimize advanced operations |

---

## 📌 Summary

This project showcases practical applications of cybersecurity frameworks like CIA Triad, NIST CSF, IAM, and the Three Lines of Defense. Each module builds on real-world risks and countermeasures to demonstrate how to establish a resilient security posture for an organization like Oscorp.
