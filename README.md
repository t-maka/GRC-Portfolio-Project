## 🔐 Cyber Security Risk Management – CIA Triad

### 🧠 Key Questions for Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: Who should access the document? Are controls in place?
- **Integrity**: Who can edit it? Are changes traceable?
- **Availability**: Should it be available 24/7? Is it backed up?

### ✅ Recommendations
- Enforce strict access controls (read/write).
- Use document encryption and versioning.
- Maintain physical and digital backups.

---

## 📋 Cyber Security Audit – Three Lines of Defense Model

### 🧱 Proposed Audit Structure
- **Line 1 – Control Owners**: Daily monitoring & incident detection.
- **Line 2 – Independent Reviewers**: Validate controls and policy adherence.
- **Line 3 – Internal Auditors**: Verify compliance and follow up.

---

## 💼 Asset Management

### 🔧 Recommendations
- Launch an asset inventory process.
- Implement a dedicated CMDB system.
- Assign ownership (e.g., GRC Analyst).
- Keep the CMDB continuously updated.

---

## 👤 Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### 🔒 IAM Observations
- Broad access to sensitive formula.
- Full admin access to database.

### ✅ Recommendations
- Implement PAM software.
- Enforce least privilege and MFA.
- Apply RBAC and ACLs.
- Segregate sensitive environments.

---

## 📣 Security Education and Awareness

### 📊 Program Evaluation
- Training module is outdated (since 2013).

### ✅ Recommendations
- Update content to reflect modern threats.
- Make training mandatory (staff, vendors, third parties).
- Run simulated phishing tests.
- Provide annual and refresher training.

---

## 🛡️ Data Security & DLP – Insider Threat Program

### 🚨 Components
- Encrypt data (at rest & in transit).
- Use DLP to prevent leaks.
- Classify data using Microsoft AIP.

---

## ⚙️ Detection & Incident Response

### 🧪 Response Plan
- Conduct baseline assessment.
- Document policies and response plans.
- Set up a cybersecurity team.
- Use SIEM/DLP tools.
- Run periodic drills.

---

## 🤝 Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM)

### 🔍 Key Risks
- No cyber framework.
- No penetration testing.
- No RBAC or access reviews.
- Training is not enforced.

### 📢 Escalate to Management
- Implement TPRM governance and monitoring.

---

## 🛠️ Vulnerability Management

### ✅ Recommendations
- Run regular scans and patching.
- Remove unauthorized software.
- Automate vulnerability management.

---

## 🧩 Capstone: Cybersecurity Program using NIST CSF

### 🔍 Gaps Identified
- No data governance or security policies.
- No SIEM, DLP, PAM.
- No third-party risk or formalized contracts.

### 📈 3-Year Roadmap

| Year | Goals |
|------|-------|
| 1️⃣ | Assess and deploy core security tools |
| 2️⃣ | Build out monitoring, IAM, and response plans |
| 3️⃣ | Integrate & optimize advanced operations |

---

## 📌 Summary

This project showcases practical applications of cybersecurity frameworks like CIA Triad, NIST CSF, IAM, and the Three Lines of Defense. Each module builds on real-world risks and countermeasures to demonstrate how to establish a resilient security posture for an organization like Oscorp.
